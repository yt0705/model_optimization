Model Compression Toolkit User Guide
============================================


Overview
========

Model Compression Toolkit (MCT) is an open source project for neural networks optimization that enables users to compress and quantize models.
This project enables researchers, developers and engineers an easily way to optimized and quantized state-of-the-art neural network.

MCT project is developed by researchers and engineers working in Sony Semiconductor Solutions.

Install
====================================
See the MCT install guide for the pip package, and build from source.

Technical Constraints
=========================

* MCT doesn't keep the structure of the model's output. For example, if the output of a model is a list of lists of Tensors [[out1, out2], out3], the optimized model output will be [out1, out2, out3]
