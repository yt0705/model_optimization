    Args:
        compute_distance_fn (Callable): Function to compute a distance between two tensors. If None, using pre-defined distance methods based on the layer type for each layer.
        distance_weighting_method (MpDistanceWeighting): distance weighting method to use. By default, MpDistanceWeighting.AVG.
        num_of_images (int): Number of images to use to evaluate the sensitivity of a mixed-precision model comparing to the float model.
        configuration_overwrite (List[int]): A list of integers that enables overwrite of mixed precision with a predefined one.
        num_interest_points_factor (float): A multiplication factor between zero and one (represents percentage) to reduce the number of interest points used to calculate the distance metric.
        use_hessian_based_scores (bool): Whether to use Hessian-based scores for weighted average distance metric
          computation. This is identical to passing distance_weighting_method=MpDistanceWeighting.HESSIAN.
        norm_scores (bool): Whether to normalize the returned scores for the weighted distance metric (to get values between 0 and 1).
        refine_mp_solution (bool): Whether to try to improve the final mixed-precision configuration using a greedy algorithm that searches layers to increase their bit-width, or not.
        metric_normalization_threshold (float): A threshold for checking the mixed precision distance metric values, In case of values larger than this threshold, the metric will be scaled to prevent numerical issues.
        hessian_batch_size (int): The Hessian computation batch size. used only if using mixed precision with Hessian-based objective.
        metric_normalization (MpMetricNormalization): Metric normalization method.
        metric_epsilon (float | None): ensure minimal distance between the metric for any non-max-bidwidth candidate
          and a max-bitwidth candidate, i.e. metric(non-max-bitwidth) >= metric(max-bitwidth) + epsilon.
          If none, the computed metrics are used as is.
        exp_distance_weighting_sigma (float): sigma for exponential weighting method. A distance for each interest point
          is normalized by sigma prior to applying exponent.
        custom_metric_fn (Callable): Function to compute a custom metric. As input gets the model_mp and returns a
