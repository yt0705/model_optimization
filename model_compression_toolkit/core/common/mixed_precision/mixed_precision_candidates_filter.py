    Filters out candidates in case of mixed precision search for only weights or activation compression.
    For instance, if running only weights compression - filters out candidates of activation configurable nodes

    base config in the FQC.

    Note: This function modifies the graph inplace!

        fw_info: fw_info: Information needed for quantization about the specific framework.
