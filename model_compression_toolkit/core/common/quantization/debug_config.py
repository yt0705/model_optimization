    A dataclass for MCT core debug information.

        analyze_similarity (bool): Whether to plot similarity figures within TensorBoard (when logger is
         enabled) or not. Can be used to pinpoint problematic layers in the quantization process.
        network_editor (List[EditRule]): A list of rules and actions to edit the network for quantization.
        simulate_scheduler (bool): Simulate scheduler behavior to compute operators' order and cuts.
        bypass (bool): A flag to enable MCT bypass, which skips MCT runner and returns the input model unchanged.
