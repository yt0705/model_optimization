    Request configuration for the Hessian-approximation scores.

    This class defines the parameters for the scores based on the Hessian matrix approximation.

    Attributes:
        mode: Mode of Hessian-approximation score (w.r.t weights or activations).
        granularity: Granularity level for the approximation.
        target_nodes: The node objects in the float graph for which the Hessian's approximation scores is targeted.
        data_loader: Data loader to compute hessian approximations on. Should reflect the desired batch size for
            the computation. Can be None if all hessians for the request are expected to be pre-computed previously.
        n_samples: The number of samples to fetch hessian estimations for. If None, fetch hessians for a full pass
            of the data loader.
        compute_from_tensors: If `True`, Hessians are computed directly from given tensors instead of using the data loader.
