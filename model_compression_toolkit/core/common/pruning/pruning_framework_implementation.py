        Retrieves the attributes of a given node along with the output/input (OI) channel axis

        Not all attributes of a node are directly associated with both input and output channels.

        channels and do not have a corresponding input channel dimension.

        For kernel operations (like convolutions), the function identifies the output and input
        channel axis based on framework-specific information.
        For non-kernel operations, it defaults to setting the last axis as the output
        channel axis, assuming no specific input channel axis.
