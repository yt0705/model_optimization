        Update the current state of the histogram bins and counts based on a new

        Args:
            x: Tensor that passes through the collector to update the histogram.

        Details:
            - The `weights` parameter allows each element of `x` to contribute a
              weighted amount to the histogram bins, rather than contributing a simple count.
            - This is particularly useful when the data being processed has an associated
              importance, frequency, or probability value that should influence the histogram.
              For example:
                - Hessian values can serve as weights for each activation in `x`.
                - Normalization of the histogram to reflect relative contributions.
            - The method ensures that `x` and `weights` have matching shapes and logs
              an error if this condition is not met.
