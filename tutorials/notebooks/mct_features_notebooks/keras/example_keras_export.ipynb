    "## Overview\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to export a Keras model to `.keras` and TFLite formats using the Model Compression Toolkit (MCT). It covers the steps of creating a simple Keras model, applying post-training quantization (PTQ) using MCT, and then exporting the quantized model to `.keras` and TFLite. The tutorial also shows how to use the exported model for inference.\n",
