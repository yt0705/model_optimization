# MCT Tutorials
Explore the Model Compression Toolkit (MCT) through our tutorials, 
covering compression techniques for Keras and PyTorch models. 
Access interactive Jupyter notebooks for hands-on learning.


## Getting started
Learn how to quickly quantize pre-trained models using MCT's post-training quantization technique for both Keras and PyTorch models.
- [Post training quantization with Keras](notebooks/imx500_notebooks/keras/example_keras_mobilenetv2_for_imx500.ipynb)
- [Post training quantization with PyTorch](notebooks/mct_features_notebooks/pytorch/example_pytorch_post_training_quantization.ipynb)

## MCT Features
This set of tutorials covers all the quantization tools provided by MCT. 
The notebooks in this section demonstrate how to configure and run simple and advanced post-training quantization methods.
This includes fine-tuning PTQ (Post-Training Quantization) configurations, exporting models,
and exploring advanced compression techniques. 
These techniques are essential for further optimizing models and achieving superior performance in deployment scenarios.
